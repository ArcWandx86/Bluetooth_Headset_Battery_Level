# üîãüéß Bluetooth Headset Battery Level

This is a python script to fetch the battery charge level of some Bluetooth headsets.

You need python 3.6 or newer to run the script.

# ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to run

### There are two options:

#### 1. Install from PyPI
Please ensure you have the BlueZ and python libraries and header files if you are using Ubuntu/Debian based distros:
```bash
sudo apt install libbluetooth-dev python3-dev
```

If you are using OpenSUSE, you will need to install these packages:
```bash
bluez
bluez-devel
python3-devel
python3-pybluez
```

Then, install with pip:
```bash
pip3 install bluetooth_battery

bluetooth_battery BT_MAC_ADDRESS_1 ...
```
_the dependency `pybluez` should be installed automatically, but if not, you may need to install it manually_

#### 2. Download this repository
```bash
chmod +x bluetooth_battery.py

./bluetooth_battery.py BT_MAC_ADDRESS_1 ...
```

_make sure you have `python-pybluez` or `python3-pybluez` or `python3-bluez` installed on your system._

**You can input addresses for as many devices as you want separated by space.**

### Finding MAC address

There are a variety of utilities that can find the MAC address of your bluetooth device.  Here is one, this command is in the `bluez` package, and the given argument gets a list of all devices it knows about, even if not currently available.
```
$ bluetoothctl devices
Device E8:AB:FA:27:9E:DE iTeknic IK-BH002
Device D0:77:14:3A:2C:24 Barak's Moto X4
Device E8:AB:FA:27:9F:49 iTeknic IK-BH002
```
The 1st and 3rd would be relevant here, as those are headsets. But if you try to get the battery level of a device that's not currently connected, there is a very long pause until the query times out.

This shows devices that are actually connected.
```
$ bluetoothctl info
Device E8:AB:FA:27:9E:DE (public)
	Name: iTeknic IK-BH002
	...
```
So you can use
```
bluetooth_battery.py $(bluetoothctl info | awk '/^Device/ {print $2}')
```
to query the battery of all connected devices.

### It didn't work?

You can set the port number manually by adding a dot at the end of mac address, like this: `00:00:00:00:00:00.3`

Try port numbers `1 to 30` to find the one that works for your device. (wait a few seconds between each try)

If that didn't work, disconnect your device first, and then try again.

### Still doesn't work?

Please consider that this script doesn't guarantee to support every bluetooth device.

You can open a new issue for discussion or check the existing ones for more information.
